# Newsletter-signUp
A web app hosted on heroku for signing up to different newsletters.  Click [here](https://smileyzz-newsletter.herokuapp.com/)  to view the project.

I created this using nodejs and express. 
Through mailchimp API,  using this web app , we can get the list of people who signed up for the newsletter service at mailchimp audience and can send them interesting newsletters according to their area of interest.
